# Checklist

This app was built by Stephen Wu (@wustep) to facilitate program requirements for the [STEM Exploration & Engagement Scholars Program](https://u.osu.edu/stemeescholars/). Checklist uses Google Spreadsheets to read and store program requirements and progress for users in any organization.

## Tech

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Checklist was written in NodeJS, using React and other packages and the [Google Spreadsheets v4 API](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/).

## Usage

Create .env file with the following variables (without comments):
```
PORT=3000			# Port to use for client & server in production, or just client in development
SERVER_PORT=3000	# Port to use for server in development
```

Run 'npm build' and then 'npm start' for production or 'npm run server' and 'npm run client' separately for development.
